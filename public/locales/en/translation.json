    "story": "Planto was born where only the succulents survived. After the tragic events of October 7, in our kibbutz near the border, only these small but resilient plants remained alive. We saw it as a sign and began to rebuild life from them. Today, every succulent we grow and sell helps us rebuild our home, our community, and our hope.<br/>We invite you to become part of this story.",
